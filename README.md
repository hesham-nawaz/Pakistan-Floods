# Pakistan-Floods
This repository contains select files from a research project on the 2010 floods I conducted with the MIT Department of Economics.

geocode_sorter.py is a program I wrote to filter the coordinates received from the geocoding API.
addresses_geocode.xlsx is an Excel sheet containing some of the methodology used for geocoding the addresses.
distance_data.dta is a Stata dataset assessing the accuracy of the geocodes returned by the geocoding program (addresses removed).
